# week 1 (03.05.21021 - 09.05.2021)
- naming of the project
  - Working title: EPICHAD (Epilepsy Child Adult)
  - Real title: Differences in EEG recordings between children and adults, living with epilepsy
  - Short discription: We want to look at the differences in EEG data in comparison between children and adults, that are living with epilepsy. Are there any general or significant disparities in the oscillation pattern during seizures and when they donâ€™t have seizures?
  - Dataset: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003555/versions/1.0.1
    There were problems with downloading this dataset --> solution: use google chrome and not firefox/safari etc.!

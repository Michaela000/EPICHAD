- Data Analysis (analysis with MNE python)
- Statistics (Calculator)
- Writing

- Timeline: Gitkraken

## What software will be utilized for the different project steps?
- Literature searching (openneuro.org)
- Writing documents (github; OSF; gitkraken)
- Preprint (gitkraken)
- Data Analysis (MNE python) 
- Statistics (python)
- Writing 

## What computing environment will be utilized for the different project steps?

- Writing documents: Bash Shell
- Data analysis: Python
- Statistics: Python

## How will the steps be documented and version controlled?
- documented in github (project.md; data.md; data_access.md; data_analysis.md; labbooks)

# Welcome!

Hello everyone & welcome to the EPICHAD project. We are happy that you found your way on our website!

We, Aicha Bouzouina & Michaela Kroth, are currently working on our Master studies in cognitive & integrative system neurosciences at the Philips University Marburg. Here on this website, we show you our work on our EPICHAD project during the summer term 2021.


## What's all this now?

At this point you might ask yourself what EPICHAD actually stands for. 
Well, it means "EPIlepsy in CHildren and ADults". As part of a module in our Masters programm, we got an insight in a typical workflow with EEG data for the very first time. In this project we investigated, if the oscillation pattern in patients that suffer from epilepsy are impacted by age and whether there are significant differences observable in the oscillation patterns between children & adults.
Here on this website we present you our progresses and results of the project.


The project includes the following parts:

* [Overview & motivation]()

  

* [Project outline & management plan]()

 

* [Dataset]()

  

* [Pre-registration]()

 

* [Open lab notebook]()

      
      
* [Data analyses]()

  
   
* [Results & outcomes]()

   

* [Poster & manuscript]()

   

* [Data access]()

   

* [Code of Conduct](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/CoC.html)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive experience.

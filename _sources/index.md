# Welcome!

Hello everyone & welcome to the EPICHAD project. We are happy that you found your way on our website!

We, Aicha Bouzouina & Michaela Kroth, are currently working on our Master studies in cognitive & integrative system neurosciences at the Philips University Marburg. Here on this website, we show you our work on our EPICHAD project during the summer term 2021.


## What's all this now?

At this point you might ask yourself what EPICHAD actually stands for. Well, it means "EPIlepsy in CHildren and ADults". As part of a module in our Masters programm, we worked for the very first time with open source EEG data.

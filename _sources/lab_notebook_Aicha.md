# Aichas lab notebook

## week 1 (03.05.21021 - 09.05.2021)
 - Naming the project
 - Working title: EPICHAD (Epilepsy Child Adult)
 - Real title: Differences in EEG recordings between children and adults, living with epilepsy
 - Short discription:
   We want to look at the differences in EEG data in comparison between children and adults, that are living with epilepsy. Are there any general or significant disparities in the oscillation pattern during seizures and when they donâ€™t have seizures?
 - Dataset: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003555/versions/1.0.1
   * There were problems with downloading this dataset --> solution: use google chrome and not firefox/safari etc.!

## week 2 (10.05.2021 - 16.05.2021)
- update readme.md
- update data.md 
- update project.md 
- create lab book for every project member(-> done by Michaela)
- get/ use GitKraken (done) & create timeline (done)
- create project on osf.io (done)
- make a preregistration  on osf (done)


## week 3 (17.05.2021 - 23.05.2021)
- literature research 


## week 4 (24.05.2021 - 30.05.2021)
- install MNE
- update labbook 


## week 5 (31.05.2021 - 06.06.2021)
- calculator homework
- update labbook

## week 6 (07.06.2021 - 13.06.2021)
- updating calculator homework (adding square root function; handling error by dividion by 0; adding comments)
- update timeline on gitkraken
- update github repository (problem automatic update of the website)
 - Data-Files
- Preprocessing of EPICHAD Dataset 
 - Problems: difficult preprocessing with bipolar channels, therefore we asked the authors for help. 
 - Result: don't use derivatives data, but the correct raw data.  

## week 7 (14.06.2021 - 20.06.2021)
- updated several files in github
- updated/ corrected calculator
- preprocessing of sub01 (still problems/errors with ICA fitting and mapping + montage )
- problem of automatically updating the website 

## week 8 (21.06.2021 - 27.06.2021)
- tried preprocessing of sub01 (still errors observed)
- tired to fix problem of website, unsuccessfully 
- informed myself more about basics of EEG and EEG data preprocessing

## week 9 (28.06.2021 - 04.07.2021)
- fixed the problem of automatically updating the website (updated TOC file)
- fixed errors in preproessing of sub01 (ICA fitting and maping works now, set correct montage)

## week 10 (05.07.2021-11.07.2021)
- Jupyter Notebook: plotted ICA_Components for each subject; created fixed epochs and created topomaps for each subject and frequency band
- Problems with subject 04, 14 & 18 appeared when we wanted to create the topomaps. (Error: There are 1 channel position not present in the DigMontage. The required channels are 'Cz2'). Therefore we excluded these three subjects for further analysis
- Jupyter Notebook Homework: look at vmin/vmax for each class (Children, Adults) and plot each frequency band again
- Github: updated all files again (data_acess; data; overview; results; ...)

## week 11 (12.07.2021-18.07.2021)
- created table with all subjects and frequency bands in order to compare them 
- updated the OSF preregistration
- updated GitHub files: results; data; overview; ...
- created overview of ICA components of all subjects
- created EPICHAD Logo
- updated index.md

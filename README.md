## What's in this repository?

This repository contains the jupyter book for the project EPICHAD conducted within Methological working in the neurosciences 2021.

- Real title: Differences in EEG recordings between children and adults, living with epilepsy
Short discription: We want to look at the differences in EEG data in comparison between children and adults, that are living with epilepsy. Are there any general or significant disparities in the oscillation pattern during seizures and when they donâ€™t have seizures?
- Dataset: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003555/versions/1.0.1

# Overview & Motivation

In epilepsy, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, >80Hz) have proven particularly important and useful. It is remarkable that this non-invasive biomarker can be found in brief intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and possibly even in extracranial EEG. To measure HFOs, it requires the EEG to be sampled at a frequency above the usual 200Hz or 500Hz (Zijlmans M. et al, 2012). Beyond their use for delineating the epileptogenic zone and facilitating surgical decision making, HFO are currently inves- tigated as potential biomarkers of epileptogenesis, disease severity and treatment response (Cserpan D. et al, 2021). However, it still remains unclear how HFOs are impacted by age in the paediatric population. 

### Aim of the study 
- Finding differences in the frequency oscillations between children and adults who have been diagnosed with epilepsy 
 
### What is the motivation to conduct the project?
- We never worked with EEG data before, and therefore we were curious what a typical workflow with EEG data would look like.
- Epilepsy is a very versatile disease and shows a lot of different progressions.
- Epileptic seizures can appear in all different age groups. We were interested to check out, if there are differences between children and adults who have been diagnosed with epilepsy.

### What is the proposed approach to conduct the project?
- Literature search
- Writing documents
- Data analysis
- Statistics
- Writing/Designing a poster
- Talk

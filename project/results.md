# Results & outcomes


## Hypothesis

### Hypothesis 1
- Children have Higher Frequency Oscillation than adult patients

### Hypothesis 2
- Children dont have higher Frequency Oscillation than adult patient 


## Results

- Topomap outcomes for vmax and vmin:
   - Adults: Delta 0.7-0.9; Theta 0.0-0.2; Alpha/Beta/Gamma 0.0-0.1 and 
   - Children: Delta 0.5-0.9; Theta 0.0-0.2; Alpha/Beta/Gamma 0.0-0.1

# Welcome!

Hello everyone & welcome to the EPICHAD project. We are happy that you found your way on our website!

We, Aicha Bouzouina & Michaela Kroth, are currently working on our Master studies in cognitive & integrative system neurosciences at the Philips University Marburg. Here on this website, we show you our work on our EPICHAD project during the summer term 2021.


## What's all this now?

At this point you might ask yourself what EPICHAD actually stands for. 
Well, it means "EPIlepsy in CHildren and ADults". As part of a module in our Masters programm, we worked for the very first time with open source EEG data. 
Here on this website we present you our progresses and results of the project.


The project includes the following parts:

* [Overview & motivation]()

  

* [Project outline & management plan]()

 

* [Dataset & management plan]()

  

* [Pre-registration]()

 

* [Open lab notebook]()

      
      
* [Data analyses]()

  
   
* [Results & outcomes]()

   

* [Poster & manuscript]()

   

* [Data access]()

   

* [Code of Conduct](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/CoC.html)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive experience.
